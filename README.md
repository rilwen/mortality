# mortality
Python implementation of the Neural Network extrapolation model. (C) Averisera Ltd 2017-2018.

The model uses a Recurrent Neural Network to extrapolate forward in time a sequence of positive rates(t, i), where t = time and i = label
(e.g. age group for mortality rates). The code is self-contained and requires only standard Python numerical libraries (Pandas, Numpy) and
TensorFlow.
